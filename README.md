# DopplerRadar
This is a Python Module that I have created to help perform various analysis related to the measurement of uncertainty in Doppler Radar percipitation predictions. The methods in the module are general enough to be applied to many other situations, as well. 

Before using the 'doppler' module, it is recommended that the data be rescaled to have mean zero and standard deviation one. 


The file 'Demo of DopplerRadar Module' gives a quick demonstration of some of the main features of this module. 

It is a Jupyter Notebook, so it is mainly for illustration purposes. 


# How To Use

To use you need to import <<doppler>> into your python script and then use the methods built within the <<dopler>> module.
